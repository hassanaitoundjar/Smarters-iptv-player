# 🔍 Debug Resume Position Issue

## What to Check

When you test Continue Watching, look for these logs in order:

### **1. When Clicking Continue Watching:**
```
🎬 Continue Watching - Movie Clicked
📍 Position: 38s
⏱️ Duration: 6228s
📊 Progress: 0.6%
🔗 Stream: http://...
```

### **2. In FullVideoScreen:**
```
🎥 FullVideoScreen - Resume position: 38s
```
OR
```
🎥 FullVideoScreen - No resume position (starting from beginning)
```

### **3. In MediaKitPlayer:**
```
🔄 Resume position requested: 38s
Playing: http://...
⏩ Seeking to 38s
▶️ Playing from 38s
```

## Expected Flow

✅ **Correct Flow:**
```

    ↓
🎬 Continue Watching - Position: 38s

## What to Look For

### **If you see:**
```
🎥 FullVideoScreen - No resume position
```
**Problem:** `resumePosition` is NULL when passed to FullVideoScreen

**Possible causes:**
- `watching[i].sliderValue` is 0 or null
- Data not loaded from storage correctly

### **If you see:**
```
🎥 FullVideoScreen - Resume position: 38s
```
But NO:
```
🔄 Resume position requested: 38s
```
**Problem:** MediaKitPlayer is not receiving the resume position

### **If you see:**
```
🔄 Resume position requested: 38s
⏩ Seeking to 38s
```
But video still starts at 0:00

**Problem:** Seek is happening but not working (timing issue)

## Quick Fix to Test

If the issue is that `resumePosition` is NULL, try this temporary fix in `watching.dart`:

```dart
final resumeSeconds = watching[i].sliderValue;

// Add this check
if (resumeSeconds <= 0) {
  debugPrint('⚠️ WARNING: Invalid resume position: $resumeSeconds');
  return;
}

debugPrint('🎬 Continue Watching - Movie Clicked');
debugPrint('📍 Position: ${resumeSeconds.toInt()}s');
```

This will tell us if the data is corrupted.

## Data Verification

Check what's actually stored in Continue Watching:

Add this to the top of the `onTap` in `watching.dart`:

```dart
onTap: () {
  final model = watching[i];
  debugPrint('=== CONTINUE WATCHING DATA ===');
  debugPrint('streamId: ${model.streamId}');
  debugPrint('sliderValue: ${model.sliderValue}');
  debugPrint('durationStrm: ${model.durationStrm}');
  debugPrint('stream: ${model.stream}');
  debugPrint('==============================');
  
  // ... rest of code
}
```

This will show us exactly what data is stored.
