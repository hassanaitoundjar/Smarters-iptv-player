# 📱 Build APK for Android - Complete Guide

## 🚀 Build Commands

### **1. Build Release APK (Single APK for all architectures)**
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
**Output:** `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
**Size:** ~50-80 MB (larger, works on all devices)

### **2. Build Split APKs (Smaller, per architecture)**
```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```
**Output:** 
- `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` (~20 MB) - 32-bit ARM
- `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (~25 MB) - 64-bit ARM (most modern phones)
- `app-x86_64-release.apk` (~30 MB) - 64-bit Intel (emulators)

### **3. Build App Bundle (For Google Play Store)**
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```
**Output:** `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

---

## 📦 APK Location

After build completes, your APK will be at:
```
/home/zerobug/Music/azul_iptv/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

---

## 🎯 Recommended Build

For distribution to users:
```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

This creates 3 smaller APKs. Users download the one for their device:
- **Most users need:** `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (modern phones)
- **Older phones:** `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`

---

## 🔧 Build Options

### **Debug APK (for testing)**
```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

### **Profile APK (for performance testing)**
```bash
flutter build apk --profile
```

### **Specific architecture only**
```bash
flutter build apk --target-platform android-arm64 --release
```

---

## 📊 Build Process

The build will:
1. ✅ Compile Dart code to native ARM
2. ✅ Bundle all assets (images, fonts, etc.)
3. ✅ Optimize and minify code
4. ✅ Sign with debug/release key
5. ✅ Create APK file

**Time:** 3-10 minutes depending on your machine

---

## 🔍 Check Build Status

```bash
# Check if build is running
ps aux | grep flutter

# Watch build output
tail -f /tmp/flutter_build.log
```

---

## 📱 Install APK on Device

### **Via USB:**
```bash
# Connect phone via USB, enable USB debugging
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### **Via File Transfer:**
1. Copy APK to phone
2. Open file manager on phone
3. Tap APK file
4. Allow "Install from unknown sources"
5. Install

## 🔐 Signing (Optional)

For production release, you should sign with your own key:

### **1. Create keystore:**
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias upload
```

### **2. Create key.properties:**
```
storePassword=<password>
keyPassword=<password>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=/home/zerobug/upload-keystore.jks
```

### **3. Update android/app/build.gradle:**
```gradle
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    ...
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Quick Commands

```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build split APKs (recommended)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release

# Install on connected device
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Check APK size
ls -lh build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Build fails:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### **Gradle issues:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter build apk --release
