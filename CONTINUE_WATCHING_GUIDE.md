# 📺 Continue Watching Feature - Complete Guide

## ✅ Feature Implemented

Your IPTV app now has **automatic Continue Watching functionality** for Movies and Series!

---

## 🎯 What It Does

The player now automatically:
1. **Tracks playback position** every 10 seconds
2. **Saves progress** to local storage
3. **Shows in "Continue Watching"** section
4. **Resumes from saved position** when reopening
5. **Works for both Movies and Series**

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Automatic Tracking:**
```
User plays a movie/series
    ↓
Player tracks position every 10 seconds
    ↓
Saves to Continue Watching list
    ↓
User closes player
    ↓
Final position saved
    ↓
Shows in Continue Watching section
    ↓
User clicks Continue Watching
    ↓
Resumes from saved position
```

---

## 📊 Smart Saving Logic

### **When It Saves:**
- ✅ Every 10 seconds during playback
- ✅ When user exits the player
- ✅ Only for VOD and Series (not Live TV)

### **When It Doesn't Save:**
- ❌ First 10 seconds (too early)
- ❌ Last 30 seconds (almost finished)
- ❌ Videos shorter than 60 seconds
- ❌ Live TV streams

### **Progress Calculation:**
```dart
Progress = Current Position / Total Duration
Example: 1200s / 3600s = 0.33 (33% watched)
```

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### **Continue Watching Section:**
```

│  │  45%   │  │  85%   │         │
│  └────────┘  └────────┘         │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Shows exact progress percentage
