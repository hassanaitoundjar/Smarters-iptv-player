# 🎬 Media Kit Player Migration

## ✅ What Was Done

Successfully migrated from multiple video players (VLC, Pod Player, FVP, Video Player) to **media_kit** - a modern, cross-platform video player.

---

## 📦 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Dependencies** (`pubspec.yaml`)

**Removed:**
```yaml
flutter_vlc_player: ^7.4.2
pod_player: ^0.2.2
video_player: ^2.9.2
fvp: ^0.35.0
```

**Added:**
```yaml
media_kit: ^1.1.10
media_kit_video: ^1.2.4
media_kit_libs_video_linux: ^1.0.4
```

### 2. **Created New Player** (`lib/presentation/screens/player/media_kit_player.dart`)

- ✅ Simple, clean implementation
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web)
- ✅ Built-in controls (play, pause, seek, volume, fullscreen)
- ✅ Error handling with retry button
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Resume playback support
- ✅ Live stream support

### 3. **Updated Main Entry Point** (`lib/main.dart`)

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize MediaKit for video playback
  MediaKit.ensureInitialized();
  
  // ... rest of initialization
}
```

### 4. **Simplified FullVideoScreen** (`lib/presentation/screens/player/full_video.dart`)

Now redirects to `MediaKitPlayer` - all existing code still works!

   - You can remove them later once you're sure everything works

3. **Linux specific:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libmpv-dev mpv
   ```

4. **macOS specific:**

   brew install mpv
   ```
