## ⚠️ REMAINING Work

### 1. Live Channels (Split Screen View)
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Migration
- **Files:**
  - `live/live_channels.dart` - Main screen with split view
  - `player/player_video.dart` - Embedded VLC player wrapper

**Current Implementation:**
- Uses `VlcPlayerController` directly for embedded player
- Shows live channel on right side with channel list on left
- Has fullscreen toggle to `StreamPlayerPage`

**Required Changes:**
1. Update `live_channels.dart`:
   - Replace `VlcPlayerController` with platform-specific controller
   - Add `PodPlayerController` for mobile
   - Add `VideoPlayerController` (fvp) for desktop
   - Update `_initialVideo()` method for both platforms

2. Update or replace `player/player_video.dart`:
   - Currently only supports VLC
   - Option A: Migrate to support both pod_player and fvp
   - Option B: Use `FullVideoScreen` when going fullscreen instead

## Summary

### What Works Now (Android/iOS):
✅ **Movies** - pod_player with beautiful UI and controls
✅ **Series** - pod_player with episode management  
✅ **Live TV Main Screen** - pod_player with EPG
✅ **Favorites** - pod_player for all content types
✅ **Full Video Player** - Complete controls and features

### What Still Uses VLC on Mobile:

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to complete the migration for Live Channels split view:

### Option 1: Full Migration (Recommended)
- Migrate `live_channels.dart` to use pod_player/fvp
- Update `player_video.dart` to support both platforms
- Consistent experience across all screens

### Option 2: Simplified Approach
- Keep embedded player as-is for now
- Use `FullVideoScreen` when going fullscreen
- Only the fullscreen view uses pod_player/fvp

### Option 3: Leave As-Is
- Live channels split view remains with VLC
- All other screens use pod_player/fvp
- Keeps VLC dependency only for this feature
