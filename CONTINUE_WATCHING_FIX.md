# 🔧 Continue Watching Resume Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Movies and series were not resuming from the saved position.

**Root Cause:** The data storage format was incorrect. We were storing progress as a ratio (0.0-1.0) but calculating resume position incorrectly.

**Solution:** Changed to store actual position and duration in seconds for accurate resume playback.

## 🎯 What Changed

### **Before (Broken):**
```dart
sliderValue: 0.33      // Progress ratio (33%)
durationStrm: 0.67     // Remaining ratio (67%)
```
- ❌ Resume calculation was wrong
- ❌ Position not restored correctly
- ❌ Progress bar calculation complex

### **After (Fixed):**
```dart
sliderValue: 1200.0    // Position in seconds (20 minutes)
durationStrm: 3600.0   // Total duration in seconds (60 minutes)
```
- ✅ Resume position = sliderValue (direct seconds)
- ✅ Progress = sliderValue / durationStrm * 100
- ✅ Simple and accurate

## 📝 Files Modified

### **1. media_kit_player.dart** ✅
**Changed:** `_saveWatchingPosition()` method

**Before:**
```dart
sliderValue: progress,           // 0.0 to 1.0
durationStrm: 1.0 - progress,    // Remaining ratio
```

**After:**
```dart
sliderValue: positionSeconds,    // Actual position in seconds
durationStrm: durationSeconds,   // Total duration in seconds
```

### **2. watching.dart** ✅
**Changed:** Resume position calculation and progress bar

**Before:**
```dart
final resumeSeconds = (model.sliderValue * model.durationStrm * 3600).toInt();
flex: (model.sliderValue * 10).round()
```

**After:**
```dart
final resumeSeconds = model.sliderValue;  // Already in seconds
flex: (model.sliderValue / model.durationStrm * 100).round()
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **Saving Position:**
```
User watches movie for 20 minutes (1200 seconds)
Total duration: 60 minutes (3600 seconds)
    ↓
Save:
  sliderValue: 1200.0
  durationStrm: 3600.0
    ↓
Progress bar shows: 33% (1200/3600)
```

### **Resuming Playback:**
```
User clicks Continue Watching
    ↓
Read sliderValue: 1200.0 seconds
    ↓
player.seek(Duration(seconds: 1200))
    ↓
Video resumes at 20:00 mark
```

---

## 🎨 Progress Bar Calculation

### **Formula:**
```dart
Progress % = (sliderValue / durationStrm) * 100
Remaining % = 100 - Progress %
```

### **Example:**
```
Position: 1200 seconds
Duration: 3600 seconds
Progress: (1200 / 3600) * 100 = 33%
Remaining: 100 - 33 = 67%
```
